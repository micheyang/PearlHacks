<p>This site allows you to upload an image of a fruit and will tell you how to determine if it is ripe. We used Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision API. The game on the home page is a tomato sorter based off of the tomato sorting video of removing the green unripe tomatoes. We were inspired by the recent trend of satisfying videos, the tomato sorting video being one. We also realized that often people go to the grocery store to buy fruit but do not know how to tell if it is ripe. This problem related to the sorting of ripe and unripe tomatoes so we combined the two ideas into one. Not only do we want to provide useful information for the customer, but we also want to entertain them. In the future we would want to turn this website into an app for easier access to the user while at a grocery store. We would also add more data for more types of fruits.</p>
